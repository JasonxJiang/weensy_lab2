Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:
Non premptive scheduling algorithm.

(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Turnaround time = burstTime + waitingTime 
burst time for all processes = 320 * one millisecond to print out the character 
Wait time for process 
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Process 1 executes at time 0 
Process 2 executes at time 1
Process 3 executes at time 2
Process 4 executes at time 3

Process 1 ends at 1280 - 3 = 1277
Process 2 ends at 1280 - 2 = 1278
Process 3 ends at 1280 - 1 = 1279
Process 4 ends at 1280 =     1280

= (1280 + 1279 + 1278 + 1277)/4 = 1278.5 ms 

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
All four processes have the same burst time (320 * 1 millisecond)
waiting time for each process 
Process 1: 0 
Process 2: 320 
Process 3: 640 
Process 4: 920 

= ((0 + 320) + (320 + 320) + (320 + 640) + (320 + 920))/4 = 800 ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Process 1 waits 0 to start 
Process 2 waits 1 to start 
Process 3 waits 2 to start 
Process waits 3 to start 

(0 + 1 + 2 +3)/4 = 1.5 milliseconds

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:

Process 1 starts at 0 and ends at 320 
Process 2 starts at 321 and ends at 640 
Process 3 starts at 641 and ends at 920 
Process 4 starts at 921 and ends at 1280 

(0 + 320 + 640 + 920)/ 4 = 480 ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?


Exercise 5:
The first known interrupt occurs on process 4. This is seen since we see that the printing
of the numbers results in 
123412341234...1231234 
A four was not printed indicating that process 4 did not finish executing and was thus 
not able to print out a 4.
